# bokeh_finance_dashboard

File bokeh-finance-dashboard.py runs via bokeh-server on the following page:
http://bokeh-finance-dashboard.herokuapp.com

App generates random financial and loan data points every time the page/app is loaded, and displays in multiple graphs and
a downloadable table.  Data is interactive with widget filters, and visualizations are interactive with tooltips and selection
capabilities.

App borrows and extends functionality set up by the following two sources:

@bryevdv's IMDB movie app:

@mattpap and @bryevdv's table download app:
